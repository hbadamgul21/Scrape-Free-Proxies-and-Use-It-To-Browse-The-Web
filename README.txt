Name: As of now it's called "ViewGenerator.py"


BACKSTORY: 

Wanted to mess around and learn more with web scraping, that I ended up working on a program that can be used to generate views for YouTube(Not 100%) or access websites that are banned overseas. By scraping free proxies from the web and using them to help mask my IP. By no means will this bypass stricter rules in place, since some of the proxies aren't elite proxies. However, if you find or purchase high proxies, you can include them manually in the code to launch chromedriver. 

This is just something fun I wanted to try and also learn from it. 

I used libraries BeautifulSoup4, Requests, Selenium, and downloaded Chromedriver. 
(I have chromedriver.exe uploaded, but just in case it does not work, download it, and set the path.)

There can be a time where all of the proxies in the list won't work, you just need to retry it. The website I'm using updates their proxies every 30 minutes.
However, you will see that I have commented out two other website you can try if the first one fails. 

USE:
run: python name.py
